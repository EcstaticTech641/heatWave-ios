# HeatWave - Complete Project README

## 🏊 Project Overview

**heatWave** is a tool that transforms USA Swimming psych sheets (entry lists) into professionally formatted heat sheets for meet operations. It eliminates hours of manual work by automating the extraction, parsing, seeding, and PDF generation workflow.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE & PRODUCTION READY**

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Coaches)

### Option 1: Download heatWave.exe (Easiest for Coaches ⭐)

1. **Download** `heatWave.exe` (~200 MB)
2. **Double-click** to launch
3. **Browser opens** automatically
4. **Use the app** - No Python or installation needed!

**That's it!** The executable includes everything needed. Works on Windows 10/11 with zero setup.

### Option 2: Python Installation (For Developers)

#### Installation (One-Time Setup)

```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd heatWave

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running the App

```bash
python run_streamlit.py
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

### Five-Step Workflow (Both Methods)

1. **Upload** your psych sheet PDF (drag & drop)
2. **Preview** parsed events to verify accuracy
3. **Customize** meet name, date, and pool lanes
4. **Generate** heat sheets (click button, wait ~5 seconds)
5. **Download** as PDFs (full meet or individual events)

---

## 📊 What It Does

### Input
- USA Swimming psych sheet PDF (any standard format)
- Typically 80-150 KB file

### Processing
1. **Extract** text from PDF (handles two-column layouts)
2. **Parse** events and swimmer entries
3. **Seed** heats using official USA Swimming rules
4. **Generate** professional PDF heat sheets

### Output
- **Full Meet PDF** - All events in one document (for meet director)
- **Individual Event PDFs** - One per event (for timers/officials)
- Both print-ready and coach-friendly formatted

### Example Results
```
Input:  Oklahoma Swimming 10-Under Championship psych sheet
        78.3 KB, 28 events, 702 swimmers

Processing: < 5 seconds

Output: 
  - Full_Meet_Heatsheets.pdf (83.7 KB, 29 pages)
  - Event_01_Heatsheet.pdf (2.9 KB)

## 💻 For Developers

### Core Components

#### 1. Parser Module (`src/parser/extractor.py`)
Extracts and parses psych sheet PDFs:
```python
from src.parser.extractor import extract_text_from_pdf, parse_events_from_text

# Extract text from PDF
text = extract_text_from_pdf("psych_sheet.pdf")

# Parse events
events = parse_events_from_text(text)
# Returns: List[Event] with parsed entries
```

#### 2. Seeding Module (`src/seeding/seeder.py`)
Creates heats with USA Swimming rules:
```python
from src.seeding.seeder import seed_event

# Seed events
heat_sheet = seed_event(event, lanes=8)
# Returns: HeatSheet with lane assignments
```

#### 3. PDF Generator (`src/core/pdf_generator.py`)
Generates printable PDF heat sheets:
```python
from src.core.pdf_generator import generate_full_meet_pdf

generate_full_meet_pdf(
    heat_sheets,
    "output.pdf",
    meet_title="My Meet",
    meet_date="01/15/2025"
)
```

#### 4. Streamlit UI (`src/ui/streamlit_app.py`)
Interactive web interface for coaches:
```bash
python run_streamlit.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Parser tests
pytest test_parsing.py

# Seeding tests
pytest test_seeding.py

# PDF generation tests
pytest test_pdf_generation.py

# Full pipeline integration
pytest test_integration.py

# Streamlit UI integration
pytest test_streamlit_integration.py
```

### Example Usage (Python)

```python
from src.parser.extractor import extract_text_from_pdf, parse_events_from_text
from src.seeding.seeder import seed_event
from src.core.pdf_generator import generate_full_meet_pdf

# 1. Extract and parse
text = extract_text_from_pdf("psych_sheet.pdf")
events = parse_events_from_text(text)

# 2. Seed all events
heat_sheets = [seed_event(e, lanes=8) for e in events]

# 3. Generate PDFs
generate_full_meet_pdf(
    heat_sheets,
    "output/heat_sheets.pdf",
    meet_title="My Meet",
    meet_date="01/15/2025"
)
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Meet Settings (in Streamlit UI)
- **Meet Title:** Name displayed on heat sheets
- **Meet Date:** Date to print (format: MM/DD/YYYY)
- **Pool Lanes:** Number of lanes (4-10, typically 8)

### Advanced (Python API)
All functions support customization:
```python
# Custom lane count
heat_sheet = seed_event(event, lanes=6)

# Custom PDF styling (ReportLab)
# Modify src/core/pdf_generator.py TableStyle
```

## 📋 USA Swimming Seeding Rules

The app implements official USA Swimming preliminary seeding:

**Heat Assignment:**
- Swimmers sorted by seed time (slowest to fastest)
- Heats filled sequentially (all fastest in Heat 1, etc.)

**Lane Placement (Center-Out):**
```
For 8-lane pool:
Lane 4 (fastest in heat) → 5 → 3 → 6 → 2 → 7 → 1 → 8
```

**Rationale:**
- Centers lanes are most consistent/fair
- Alternating out prevents bias
- Matches official USA Swimming standard

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Error processing PDF"**
- Verify it's a valid USA Swimming psych sheet
- Try a different PDF from your meet software

**"No events found"**
- Check the PDF format (should be standard text-based)
- Scanned PDFs may need OCR (future feature)

**"Missing swimmers"**
- The app extracts only what's in the PDF
- Check if swimmers are actually in your psych sheet

**"PDF looks wrong"**
- Check Preview tab first to verify parsing
- Customize settings (meet title, date, lanes)
- Try regenerating

pyinstaller --clean heatWave.spec

# The result: dist/heatWave/heatWave.exe (~200 MB)
```

**Test the .exe:**
```bash
# Option 1: Test with PowerShell script
.\test-exe.ps1

# Option 2: Manual test
cd dist\heatWave
.\heatWave.exe
```

**Distribute to Coaches:**
1. Zip the entire `dist/heatWave/` folder
2. Share via email, Google Drive, Dropbox, or website
3. Coaches download and extract
4. Double-click `heatWave.exe` to launch
5. Browser opens automatically - they're ready to use!
